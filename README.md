# pyeasydcer
Python Script which makes exporting Drupal default content in Drupal a lot easier than manually doing it

##### Work Done
+ Complete support for DCER - Script can export any number of entities in just a matter of minutes
+ Works perfectly on unix systems
+ Supports Lando (lando users need to add lando parameter when running the script so as to enable lando mode)

##### Work to be done
+ Windows support
+ Multithreading support to make the execution time more faster

##### Perks
+ User can export any number of entities in one go
+ User need not enter subscription name and path where local setup is located every time they export defult content
+ Script asks the user to enter config when they run it for the first time
    + For the next 6 hours script will not ask user to input subscription or path making user's work a bit more easy
+ And the best part is there is no need for the user to enter arguments in a particular order, user can enter arguments in any order the script will take care of the problem of handling all that stuff.

#### Requirements
+ Python v3.7+
+ pip3

#### Usage:
  + `pyeasydcer <entity_type> <id's of entities separated by a comma(,)`
  + `pyeasydcer <entity_type> <id's of entities separated by a comma(,) lando` (if using lando enviroment)
